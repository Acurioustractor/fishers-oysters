  "excerpt": "",
  "content": "Craig walks Palm Island daily, carrying a stick for protection from dogs. During the floods, he continued his walks, observing the storm's impact across the community. While he personally wasn't badly affected, his daily walks gave him unique insight into which areas flooded worst and how different families were coping. Craig's story represents the quiet observers who know their community intimately through regular presence and movement through its spaces.",
