  "excerpt": "",
  "content": "Community members discuss critical native title issues and the reclamation of traditional names. \"Gunnamaru\" is the traditional name for all the islands in the group, while \"Bugumanbara\" specifically refers to the Great Palm Islands. This conversation about naming represents the broader struggle to restore Indigenous sovereignty and recognition. Even during storm recovery, the community continues work on native title claims - refusing to let colonial names and structures erase traditional ownership and identity. Meeting scheduling conflicts reveal the challenge of balancing recovery work with ongoing land rights advocacy.",
