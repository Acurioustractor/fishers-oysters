  "title": "Christopher: The Storm Revealed Government Failures",
  "excerpt": "",
  "content": "Christopher speaks powerfully about how the storm exposed systemic failures in government support for First Nations people. Palm Island lacks proper evacuation centers despite being cyclone-prone. Store prices remain prohibitively expensive. First Nations people face disproportionate incarceration rates. The ongoing impacts of colonization - alcohol, drugs, and intergenerational trauma - are exacerbated during disasters. Christopher's testimony demands accountability and better emergency infrastructure for remote Aboriginal communities.",
