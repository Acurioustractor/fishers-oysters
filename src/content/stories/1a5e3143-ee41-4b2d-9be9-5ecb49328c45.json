  "content": "Palm Island community members discuss innovative projects addressing practical needs during recovery. Experimental collapsible beds and washing machine distribution programs help families recover from storm damage. Connections with Orange Sky bring mobile laundry services to the community. The high cost of goods on Palm Island makes these initiatives even more critical. Programs bridge generations, bringing youth and elders together to share knowledge and support community rebuilding.",
