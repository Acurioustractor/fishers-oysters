# Summary
Partnership supporting sustainable aquaculture and community enterprise on Moreton Bay. Restoring oyster industry as Indigenous-led ecological and economic revitalisation.
Mission
To reclaim, restore, and reimagine Moreton Bay's oyster industry as a cornerstone of Indigenous sovereignty, cultural resilience, and ecological justice - guided by the truth that oysters are not commodities, they are kin.

- Community readiness: Quandamooka leaders like Shaun Fisher developing proven models for cultural enterprise
- Climate action imperative: Oyster restoration essential for carbon sequestration and marine ecosystem resilience
🧭 How it works
