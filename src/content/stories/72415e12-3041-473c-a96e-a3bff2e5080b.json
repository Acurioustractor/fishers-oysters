  "content": "Community leaders discuss the critical intersection of storytelling, data sovereignty, and disaster recovery. The Movember men's program brings $1.9 million over 5 years to support men's wellbeing. Storm recovery efforts include coordinated food distribution networks. Central to all of this is working with elders to preserve traditional knowledge and ensure the community controls its own stories and data.
