  "content": "# The Technical Architecture of Empathy\n\nBuilding technology for storytelling isn't just a technical challenge - it's a human one. Here's how we approach it.\n\n## Principles First\n\nBefore writing any code, we established core principles:\n\n1. **Data Sovereignty**: Communities own their data. Period.\n2. **Cultural Safety**: Technology must respect and protect cultural protocols.\n3. **Accessibility**: Simple enough for anyone, powerful enough for professionals.\n4. **Sustainability**: Built to last, not to scale at any cost.\n\n## The Stack\n\nWe chose technologies that support these principles:\n\n- **Next.js 15**: Modern React framework for fast, accessible interfaces\n- **Supabase**: PostgreSQL database with row-level security for true data ownership\n- **TypeScript**: Type safety prevents errors and makes the code maintainable\n- **Tailwind CSS**: Consistent, accessible design system\n\n## Multi-Tenancy Done Right\n\nEvery organization, every community, gets their own data silo. This isn't just about security - it's about sovereignty. Your data never mingles with anyone else's unless you explicitly choose to share.\n\n## AI That Serves, Not Surveils\n\nWe use AI thoughtfully:\n- Transcription makes stories accessible\n- Theme extraction helps surface connections\n- But humans always review, approve, and control\n\nAI never makes decisions about cultural sensitivity. That's for communities and their elders to determine.\n\n## The Consent System\n\nEvery piece of data has explicit consent tracking:\n- What was consented to\n- When it was given\n- Who can access it\n- How it can be used\n\nConsent can be withdrawn at any time, and the system respects that immediately.\n\n## Performance and Privacy\n\nFast doesn't mean compromising privacy:\n- Edge caching for public content\n- Direct database connections for sensitive queries\n- No third-party analytics that leak data\n- No tracking pixels or surveillance capitalism\n\n## Open by Default\n\nThe code is transparent. The decisions are documented. The principles are public.\n\nWe're not building a black box. We're building a tool that communities can understand, trust, and if they want, run themselves.\n\n---\n\n*Technology should serve human connection, not exploit it.*",
